# Bank Data Providers - Architecture Overview

## System Purpose

The bank-data-providers system is a modular framework for connecting users' bank accounts and syncing financial data. It supports multiple providers (Monobank, Enable Banking, LunchFlow) through a unified interface using the Provider Pattern and Registry Pattern.

## Core Concepts

### Provider Registry (Singleton)

All providers register at app startup via `initializeBankProviders()`. Services look up providers dynamically:

```typescript
const provider = bankProviderRegistry.get(BANK_PROVIDER_TYPE.MONOBANK);
await provider.fetchAccounts(connectionId);
```

### Database Models

| Model                         | Purpose                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BankDataProviderConnections` | Stores connection metadata, encrypted credentials, consent info |
| `Accounts`                    | User accounts linked via `bankDataProviderConnectionId`         |
| `Transactions`                | Transactions with `originalId` for deduplication                |

### Sync Status (Redis)

```
account:{accountId}:sync-status → { status, startedAt, completedAt, error }

States: IDLE → QUEUED → SYNCING → COMPLETED
                  ↓
               FAILED
```

---

## Flow 1: Connection

### Monobank (Simple Token)

```
User provides API token
       ↓
POST /monobank/connect
       ↓
MonobankProvider.connect()
  • Validate token via API call
  • Encrypt and store credentials
  • Return connectionId
       ↓
Connection immediately ACTIVE
```

### Enable Banking (OAuth2)

```
User provides: appId, privateKey, bankName, bankCountry
       ↓
POST /enablebanking/connect
       ↓
EnableBankingProvider.connect()
  • Validate private key format
  • Generate OAuth state (CSRF protection)
  • Call startAuthorization() → returns auth URL
  • Store pending connection (isActive = false)
  • Return connectionId
       ↓
Frontend redirects user to auth URL
       ↓
User authorizes at bank
       ↓
POST /enablebanking/oauth-callback
       ↓
EnableBankingProvider.handleOAuthCallback()
  • Validate state parameter
  • Exchange code for session
  • Store sessionId in credentials
  • Set isActive = true
       ↓
Connection now ACTIVE
```

### LunchFlow (API Key)

```
User provides API key
       ↓
POST /lunchflow/connect
       ↓
LunchFlowProvider.connect()
  • Validate API key via test connection
  • Encrypt and store credentials
  • Return connectionId
       ↓
Connection immediately ACTIVE
```

---

## Flow 2: Account Selection & Creation

This is a **two-stage process**:

### Stage 1: List Available Accounts

```
GET /connections/{connectionId}/available-accounts
       ↓
listExternalAccounts() service
       ↓
provider.fetchAccounts(connectionId)
       ↓
Returns account list (NOT saved to DB)
       ↓
Frontend displays for user selection
```

### Stage 2: Connect Selected Accounts

```
POST /connections/{connectionId}/sync-selected-accounts
Body: { accountExternalIds: ["acc1", "acc2"] }
       ↓
connectSelectedAccounts() service
       ↓
For each selected account:
  • Check if exists (by externalId + connectionId)
  • If exists: re-enable (isEnabled = true)
  • If new: create Accounts record with:
    - Proper ref amounts (calculateRefAmount)
    - Link to connection
    - Balance, currency, metadata
       ↓
Enqueue the initial transaction sync on the `account-sync` queue
       ↓
Return created accounts (sync still running in the background)
```

**Key file:** `connection/connect-selected-accounts.ts`

This is where accounts are actually created with proper `refInitialBalance` and `refCurrentBalance` calculations.

The response returns as soon as account creation commits — a first backfill can run for minutes. Clients poll `GET /sync/status` for per-account progress.

---

## Flow 3: Transaction Sync

### Monobank: Queue-Based (BullMQ)

```
syncTransactionsForAccount()
       ↓
MonobankProvider.syncTransactions()
       ↓
Set status = QUEUED
       ↓
Calculate 31-day batches (rate limit constraint)
       ↓
Queue jobs via BullMQ (1 job per batch)
       ↓
Return immediately: { jobGroupId, totalBatches }
       ↓
BACKGROUND (BullMQ Worker):
  For each batch:
    • Fetch transactions from API
    • Check duplicates by originalId
    • Create Transaction records
    • Update account balance
  When done: status = COMPLETED
```

**Why queue-based?**

- Monobank has 1 request per 60 seconds rate limit
- Historical sync can need 10+ requests
- Can't block HTTP response for 10+ minutes

### Enable Banking: Direct Sync

```
syncTransactionsForAccount()
       ↓
EnableBankingProvider.syncTransactions()
       ↓
Set status = SYNCING
       ↓
Fetch all transactions (paginated on continuation_key until the ASPSP
stops returning one; an initial sync also negotiates the lookback window
by retrying 1095 → 730 → 365 → 90 days on date-range rejections)
       ↓
Sort by date ascending, pre-booking (PDNG/HOLD) before BOOK within the
same date so a same-batch booked copy finds its pending row already stored
       ↓
For each transaction:
  • Generate deterministic externalId (SHA256 hash)
  • Match against existing rows with the four-tier matcher (see below)
  • CNCL/RJCT → delete the matched pre-booking row (kept when it has
    dependent rows); never creates one. SCHD never reaches this loop
  • Matched, stored booked + incoming pre-booking → no writes (stale re-send)
  • Matched → re-anchor originalId, merge externalData (pendingHash +
    merchantName backfill), flip pre-booking → BOOK, re-stamp time when the
    flip changed it, refresh the note while it is still sync-generated
  • Unmatched → create Transaction record
       ↓
Update account balance
       ↓
Set status = COMPLETED
```

**Four-tier match** (`findExistingTransactionForSync`), strongest evidence first:

1. **entry_reference** — the ASPSP promises it is unique and immutable per account
2. **originalId** — the stored hash; the steady state when the bank returns stable fields. It also matches `externalData.pendingHash`, the hash a row carried during its pending life, so a `PDNG` payload the ASPSP re-sends after booking resolves back onto the booked row instead of creating a duplicate
3. **IBAN fingerprint** — same amount/currency/type within ±2 days, same counterparty IBAN, and only against rows that carry no stored entry_reference
4. **Pending upgrade** — a booked payload adopts a stored `PDNG`/`HOLD` row with the same amount/currency/type within ±5 days. The IBAN gate is conditional: when the incoming booked payload carries a counterparty IBAN the candidate must carry the same one (an IBAN-less candidate is rejected), and when it carries none — the card-purchase case — no IBAN filtering happens. The candidate pool also excludes rows with an entry_reference, a `transferId`, or `refundLinked`. The whole tier is skipped when a single pre-sync count says the account holds no pre-booking rows at all; that pre-check re-arms mid-run as soon as this run stores one

Tier 3 runs before tier 4 because IBAN equality is the stronger signal — an incoming transfer must not consume an unrelated IBAN-less card pending.

**Why direct?**

- Enable Banking has generous rate limits
- Pagination runs inside one sync call and finishes fast
- Completes within HTTP timeout

### LunchFlow: Direct Sync (Post-Fetch Filtering)

```
syncTransactionsForAccount()
       ↓
LunchFlowProvider.syncTransactions()
       ↓
Set status = SYNCING
       ↓
Fetch ALL transactions (API has no date-range support)
       ↓
Filter out pending transactions (null IDs)
       ↓
Post-fetch date filtering:
  • Find latest existing transaction date in DB
  • Discard API transactions older than that date
       ↓
For each remaining transaction:
  • Primary dedup: check by originalId
  • Secondary dedup: check externalData.originalSource.originalId
  • Create Transaction record
       ↓
Update account balance
       ↓
Set status = COMPLETED
```

**Why post-fetch filtering?**

- LunchFlow API does NOT support date-range query parameters
- Without filtering, every sync re-processes all historical transactions
- Post-fetch filtering avoids duplicates when manual transactions exist (see Flow 6)

---

## Flow 4: Auto-Sync

```
POST /sync/trigger (or scheduled trigger)
       ↓
syncAllUserAccounts()
       ↓
Fetch all user's bank-connected accounts, grouped by connection
       ↓
enqueueAccountSync() per connection: accounts set to QUEUED, jobs added
       ↓
`account-sync` BullMQ worker (concurrency 5) picks jobs up
       ↓
Frontend polls GET /sync/status for progress
```

One job per account, except batch-capable providers (SimpleFIN), which get one
job per connection so a single windowed fetch covers every account. Monobank's
job fans out into its own rate-limited queue. Job ids are deterministic
(`account-sync-<accountId>` / `account-sync-<connectionId>`), so re-triggering a
sync that is still queued or running is a no-op.

**Key file:** `sync/account-sync-queue.ts`

---

## Flow 5: Disconnect Provider

**CRITICAL**: Disconnecting a provider MUST reset all linked accounts to `system` type. Without this, accounts retain their provider-specific type (e.g. `lunchflow`) and cannot be relinked because the UI only shows the "Link" button for `system`-type accounts.

### With `removeAssociatedAccounts=false` (default)

```
DELETE /connections/{connectionId}?removeAssociatedAccounts=false
       ↓
disconnectProvider() service
       ↓
For each linked account:
  unlinkAccountFromBankConnection()
    • Account type → system
    • bankDataProviderConnectionId → null
    • externalId → null
    • Store connection history in externalData
    • All transactions: accountType → system, originalId → null
    • Preserve originalId in externalData.originalSource (for relink dedup)
       ↓
provider.disconnect(connectionId)
  • Provider-specific cleanup (e.g. revoke OAuth session)
  • Delete BankDataProviderConnections record
```

### With `removeAssociatedAccounts=true`

```
DELETE /connections/{connectionId}?removeAssociatedAccounts=true
       ↓
Permanently delete all linked accounts (and their transactions via CASCADE)
       ↓
provider.disconnect(connectionId)
```

**Key file:** `connection/disconnect-provider.ts`, `accounts/unlink-from-bank-connection.ts`

---

## Flow 6: Unlink → Manual Edits → Relink (Account-Level)

This is the per-account unlink/relink flow (distinct from full provider disconnect).

```
1. User unlinks a single account (POST /accounts/{id}/unlink)
       ↓
   unlinkAccountFromBankConnection()
     • Account type → system
     • externalId → null, bankDataProviderConnectionId → null
     • Store connection history in externalData.connectionHistory
     • Transactions: originalId → null, accountType → system
     • Preserve originalId in externalData.originalSource
       ↓
2. User may add manual transactions while account is unlinked
       ↓
3. User relinks account (POST /accounts/{id}/link)
       ↓
   linkAccountToBankConnection()
     • Account type → provider type (e.g. lunchflow)
     • Set externalId and bankDataProviderConnectionId
       ↓
4. Transaction sync runs
       ↓
   Two-tier deduplication prevents duplicates (LunchFlow, SimpleFIN, Walutomat):
     Primary: check by originalId (fast path)
     Secondary: check externalData.originalSource.originalId (covers unlink→relink)
     Enable Banking folds the originalSource check into tier 2 of its
     four-tier matcher (see Flow 3)
       ↓
   Date-based filtering (all providers):
     Find latest existing transaction date → skip older API transactions
     This ensures manual transactions added during unlink period are preserved
     and only truly new bank transactions are imported
     Note: Monobank/Enable Banking filter via API params; LunchFlow filters post-fetch
```

### Why Two-Tier Dedup?

When an account is unlinked, `originalId` is set to `null` on all transactions. The original value is preserved in `externalData.originalSource.originalId`. On relink + sync (LunchFlow, SimpleFIN, Walutomat):

1. **Primary dedup** (by `originalId`) won't match — the field is null
2. **Secondary dedup** checks `externalData.originalSource.originalId` via JSONB query
3. If found, restores `originalId` so future syncs use the fast primary path

### Why Date-Based Filtering Matters

If a user unlinks, adds a manual transaction dated today, then relinks — without date filtering, the sync would re-process all historical transactions from the API. With filtering:

- System finds the latest transaction date (the manual one)
- Only processes API transactions on or after that date
- Old bank transactions are skipped (they already exist via secondary dedup or are too old)
- New bank transactions after the manual one are imported normally

---

## Flow 7: Auth Failure Tracking

Providers that use API keys (LunchFlow) track consecutive authentication failures:

```
API call fails with ForbiddenError
       ↓
handleAuthError()
  • Increment consecutiveAuthFailures in metadata
  • If failures >= 2: deactivate connection (isActive = false)
  • Store deactivationReason = 'auth_failure'
       ↓
On next successful API call:
  resetAuthFailures()
  • Reset counter to 0
```

User can reactivate by updating credentials via `refreshCredentials()`.

## Key Implementation Details

### Transaction Amount Handling

Amounts are **always stored as positive values**. The `transactionType` field determines expense vs income:

```typescript
// Monobank - API returns signed amounts
amount: Math.abs(data.amount),
transactionType: data.amount > 0 ? 'income' : 'expense',

// Enable Banking - uses credit_debit_indicator
const isExpense = tx.credit_debit_indicator === CreditDebitIndicator.DBIT;
amount: Math.abs(tx.amount),
transactionType: isExpense ? 'expense' : 'income',
```

### Transaction Deduplication

Each provider generates a unique `externalId` for transactions:

- **Monobank:** Uses API-provided `id`
- **Enable Banking:** when the payload carries an `entry_reference`, SHA256 of `{ accountExternalId, entry_reference }`. Otherwise SHA256 over accountExternalId, amount, currency, credit_debit_indicator, one date (priority `transaction_date` > `value_date` > `booking_date`) and the debtor/creditor IBANs. Remittance text is deliberately not hashed
- **LunchFlow:** Uses API-provided `id` (pending transactions with null IDs are filtered out)

**Two-tier dedup** (LunchFlow, SimpleFIN and Walutomat):

1. **Primary:** Check `originalId` column — fast, covers normal re-sync
2. **Secondary:** Check `externalData.originalSource.originalId` via JSONB query — covers unlink→relink flow where `originalId` was cleared to null but the value was preserved in `externalData`

If secondary dedup finds a match, it restores `originalId` so future syncs use the fast primary path.

**Enable Banking folds the `originalSource` check into its own four-tier matcher** (entry_reference → originalId hash / pendingHash / originalSource → IBAN fingerprint → pending upgrade, see Flow 3). The matcher exists because some ASPSPs populate `entry_reference` only on later syncs, shift the date that feeds the hash, and re-issue a `PDNG` card purchase as a `BOOK` row with a fresh reference and different remittance text — each of which would otherwise produce a duplicate. The `originalSource` branch covers unlink→relink for rows with no `entry_reference` and no counterparty IBAN, which no other tier can match; the sync loop's re-anchor step then restores `originalId`.

**Reconciliation of pre-existing duplicates:** `POST /connections/:id/reconcile-duplicates` runs `reconcileDuplicateTransactionsForAccount`, which buckets an account's transactions by (amount, currency, transactionType) and makes two passes:

- **Pass (a)** pairs booked rows with leftover pre-booking rows, nearest-first. The directional window accepts a booked row dated at or after its pending copy, up to 5 days later. The same conditional IBAN gate as tier 4 applies: a booked row with a counterparty IBAN only pairs with a pending row carrying that exact IBAN; a booked row without one is not IBAN-filtered. One booked row adopts at most one pending row. User edits on the pending copy (note, category + its `categorizationMeta` stamp, paymentType, locked payee) migrate onto the survivor; divergent edits on both sides skip the pair, and a skipped pair leaves both rows free to pair with someone else. A moved category always arrives with a manual stamp — synthesized when the pending row only had the legacy null-stamp signal — so the next AI run leaves it alone, and an orphan-only manual stamp moves even when both sides already share the category. The survivor also inherits the pending row's hash as `externalData.pendingHash`, so a re-sent `PDNG` payload resolves through tier 2 instead of recreating the duplicate. Any pending row pass (a) touched — merged or skipped — is excluded from pass (b), as is any booked row that received a merge.
- **Pass (b)** pairs a row that has an `entry_reference` with one that has none, within ±2 days and sharing a counterparty IBAN. It is stricter than pass (a) — the pairing evidence is circumstantial, so any scalar divergence aborts the merge instead of migrating. It compares against canonicals as pass (a) left them, so an edit pass (a) just migrated can block a later strict merge.

Both passes refuse to delete an orphan that has dependent rows (`transferId`, `refundLinked`, splits, tags, refunds in either direction, budgets, subscriptions, group membership), and both are idempotent. The endpoint returns `{ mergedCount, skippedCount, consideredPairs, unresolvedCount }` — `consideredPairs` counts pass-(a) pairs that survived the IBAN gate and the directional window, and `unresolvedCount` counts pairs and rows that produced neither a merge nor a skip (IBAN drops, direction rejects, already-taken members, orphans with no partner).

### Enable Banking Reconnection

When consent expires and user reauthorizes:

1. Enable Banking assigns **new account UUIDs**
2. System matches accounts by **IBAN + currency** (stable identifiers)
3. Updates `externalId` on existing Accounts records
4. Transactions continue to link correctly

### Credential Security

```
Raw credentials → encryptCredentials() → Stored in DB (JSONB)
                                              ↓
                      getDecryptedCredentials() → Used in provider methods
```
